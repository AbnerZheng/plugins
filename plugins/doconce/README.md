This plugin adds support for the [doconce markup](https://github.com/hplgit/doconce)

Because of reasons, if you want to install doconce via pip, you need to use

```
pip  install --allow-external doconce --allow-unverified doconce doconce
```

This plugin is experimental and I am not actively using it, just provided for
anyone who may want to explore it.
